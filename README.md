# Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam Resources

![NI Raspberry Jam sign](images/NIJam.jpg)
This is collection of all the materials we have used at the Northern Ireland Raspberry Jams.   
We have used a number of activities from the [Raspberry Pi Foundation's excellent resources section](https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/) and have also developed a number of our own.
